# Stock Analysis with Excel VBA

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The task was to analyze 12 stocks from 2017 and 2018 and determine their total daily volume and yearly return for each stock. By looking at the total daily volume we will be able to get a snaphsot of how actively a particular stock is being traded. While the yearly return will allows us to measure how well the stock performed from the beginning of the year to the end.

## Results

### Stock Performances between 2017 and 2018

#### A Look at 2017 Total Daily Volume
When we analyze the stock for 2017, the results provide a variety of stocks that performed well with varying degree of total daily volume and return in the positve.

To get a better understanding of the stocks that were most active we sorted the results to show the most active at the top of the list.

Keep in mind as the list shows several stocks that had been very active and had very positive returns, this is only sample size of years' worth of data we must continue on with our analyis before making any rushed conclusions.

#### A Look at 2017 Return
It was a good year for many of the stocks on the list. Only one stock, TERP finished the year below where it started at the beginning of 2017. Again we sorted the table to show the best performers for the year to display them at the top of the list.

If 2017 data is all that we had, then our analysis would give us a few stocks that could possibly be investment candidates but with only the year sample it leaves the decision to invest a more difficult one to process. Thankfully we do have 2018 data to analyze and compare to 2017, so let us look at how these stocks faired in 2018 to see how we would have done.

#### A Look at 2018 Total Daily Volume
The story in 2018 seems to have a completely different one.

At first glance we see that many of the Returns were in the negative but let's review the Total Daily Volume. Let's sort the table again by the largest volume at the top.
